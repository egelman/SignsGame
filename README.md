This game was inspired by a trip upstate NY where there were _a lot_ of signs 
![a lot of signs](https://i.ibb.co/nC5314d/Screenshot-2024-07-24-at-10-43-51-PM.jpg) 
With each round of the game, you have less time to find the right sign. The faster you find the sign, the more bonus points you get.
Each round brings more signs and more chaos and challenge. High scores are stored locally. Good luck! Play [here](https://seeingsigns.pages.dev/).
